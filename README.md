## React Playground â€“ Sign Up Screen ðŸ”‘

Hey all! ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to share with you a simple Sign Up Screen created as a part of "React Playground" - my endeavour to learn React.

Feel free to check it out in [Figma Community](../) where you can find the designs along with the design system. 

Huge thanks to Adhithya for creating a [fantastic React sign-up app tutorial](https://www.adhithyakumar.com/blog-posts/react-for-designers-creating-a-simple-login-screen) based on which I could create this project!
