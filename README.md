## React Playground – Sign Up Screen 🔑

Hey all! 👋

I wanted to share with you a simple Sign Up Screen created as a part of "React Playground" - my endeavour to learn React.

Feel free to check it out in [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/871047474416090189/React-Playground-%E2%80%93-Sign-Up-Screen-%F0%9F%94%91) where you can find the designs along with the design system. 

Huge thanks to Adhithya for creating a [fantastic React sign-up app tutorial](https://www.adhithyakumar.com/blog-posts/react-for-designers-creating-a-simple-login-screen) based on which I could create this project!
